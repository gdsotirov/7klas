# TODO

Things to implement if/when there's time:

* Migrate to Vue.js (see [#3](https://github.com/gdsotirov/7klas/issues/3)). Resources:
  - Vue.js [official site](https://vuejs.org/);
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [online tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/vue/);
  - [Comparison with AngularJS](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html?redirect=true#AngularJS-Angular-1).
* Class rankings by sex (where applicable)
    * Add information about sex for class rankings
    * Allow user to define student's sex in the application
    * Filter out rankings by sex (optionally?) and make better ranking
    considering student's sex
* Find way to parse and import rankings in database
