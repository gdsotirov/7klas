# TODO

Things to implement if/when there's time:

* Class rankings by sex (where applicable)
    * Add information about sex for class rankings
    * Allow user to define student's sex in the application
    * Filter out rankings by sex (optionally?) and make better ranking
    considering student's sex
* Find way to parse and import rankings in database
